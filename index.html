	<h4>Champions don't just happen, it is hard work, earned respect and support from the Nation, Family, Friends and community Members.</h4>
			<h4>Every Kitkatla Warrior from Gitxaala comes from strong teaching from newborns to adulthood. Matriarchs have been grooming them for a life of hardwork, respectful mannerism, and pride of not only where they come from but where they are going. </h4>
